Python - DTracing Python

   These scripts trace the Python programming language, and require a version
   of Python which has been built with DTrace probes.

   The Python DTrace provider was originally written by John Levon, and
   was integrated into Solaris Nevada in build 65. If you are on a different
   OS with DTrace and would like to use these scripts, you could download
   Python and the Python DTrace provider patch listed in the comments here,

	http://blogs.oracle.com/levon/entry/python_and_dtrace_in_build

   You will need patch and build Python for these probes to work.
   Or, check if a pre-built package is available someone on opensolaris.org.

   Since the DTrace Python provider may be developed further, there is a chance
   that it has changed slightly by the time you are reading this, causing
   these scripts to either break or behave oddly. Firstly, check for newer
   versions of the DTraceToolkit; if it hasn't been updated and you need
   to use these scripts immediately, then updating them shouldn't take
   too long. The following was the state of the provider when these scripts
   were written - check for changes and update the scripts accordingly,

	provider python {
	    probe function-entry(file, subroutine, lineno)
	    probe function-return(file, subroutine, lineno)
	};
