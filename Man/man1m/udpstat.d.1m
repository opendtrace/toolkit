udpstat.d \- print UDP statistics. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
udpstat.d is a DTrace program to print UDP statistics every second,
retrieved from the MIB provider.

The UDP statistics are documented in the mib2_tcp struct
in /usr/include/inet/mib2.h; and also in the mib provider
chapter of the DTrace Guide, found at 
http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23824_01/html/E22973.

Since this uses DTrace, only the root user or users with the
dtrace_kernel privilege can run this command.
