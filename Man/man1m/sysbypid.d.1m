.SH DESCRIPTION
sysbypid.d is a simple DTrace program to print System
statistics by process.

The system statistics are documented in the cpu_sysinfo struct
in the /usr/include/sys/sysinfo.h file; and also in the sysinfo provider
chapter of the DTrace Guide, http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23824_01/html/E22973.

dtrace_kernel privilege can run this command.
