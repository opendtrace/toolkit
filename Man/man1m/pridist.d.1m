.TH pridist.d 1m  "$Date:: 2007-08-05 #$" "USER COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
pridist.d \- process priority distribution. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pridist.d
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a simple DTrace script that samples at 1000 Hz which process
is on the CPUs, and what the priority is. A distribution plot is printed.

With priorities, the higher the priority the better chance the process
(actually, thread) has of being scheduled.

This idea came from the script /usr/demo/dtrace/profpri.d, which
produces similar output for one particular PID.

Since this uses DTrace, only the root user or users with the
dtrace_kernel privilege can run this command.
