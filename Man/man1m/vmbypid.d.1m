.SH DESCRIPTION
vmbypid.d is a simple DTrace program to print Virtual Memory
statistics by process.

The virtual memory statistics are documented in the cpu_vminfo struct
in the /usr/include/sys/sysinfo.h file; and also in the vminfo provider
chapter of the DTrace Guide, http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23824_01/html/E22973.

Since this uses DTrace, only the root user or users with the
dtrace_kernel privilege can run this command.
