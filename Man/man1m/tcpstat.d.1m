.SH NAME
tcpstat.d \- print TCP statistics. Uses DTrace.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tcpstat.d
.SH DESCRIPTION
tcpstat.d is a DTrace program to print TCP statistics every second,
retrieved from the MIB provider.

This program can be used to help identify how utilised the network 
interfaces may be, as well as TCP transmission errors.

The TCP statistics are documented in the mib2_tcp struct
in /usr/include/inet/mib2.h; and also in the mib provider
chapter of the DTrace Guide, found at 
http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23824_01/html/E22973.

Since this uses DTrace, only the root user or users with the
dtrace_kernel privilege can run this command.
.SH OS
