The following is an example of connections. As inbound TCP connections are 
established their details are printed out. This includes the PID of the
server process that is listening on that port,

 # ./connections
 ZONE_ID     PID       IP_SOURCE    PORT
       0  100504  10.132.145.148      22
 ^C

Here's an example with timestamp (string) and zone printout

 # ./connections -vZ
 TIMESTR              ZONE        ZONE_ID     PID       IP_SOURCE    PORT
 2014 Jul  1 15:01:16 global            0  100504  10.132.145.148      22
 ^C

In another window snoop was running for comparison,

 # snoop 'tcp[13:1] = 0x02'
 Using device net0 (promiscuous mode)
 mars -> jupiter TCP D=22 S=50263 Syn Seq=372663324 Len=0 Win=8192 Options=<mss 1460,nop,wscale 2,nop,nop,sackOK>
 ^C

snoop can already tell me that these connections are happening - but does not
print out details of the server that accepted the connection.
