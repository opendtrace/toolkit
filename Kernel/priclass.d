/*
 * priclass.d - priority distribution by scheduling class.
 *              Written using DTrace (Solaris 10 3/05)
 *
 * This is a simple DTrace script that samples at 1000 Hz the current
 * thread's scheduling class and priority. A distribution plot is printed.
 *
 * With priorities, the higher the priority the better chance the thread
 * has of being scheduled.
 *
 * This idea came from the script /usr/demo/dtrace/pri.d, which
 * produces similar output for priority changes, not samples.
 *

 *
 * USAGE:       priclass.d      # hit Ctrl-C to end sampling
 *
 * FIELDS:
 *              value           process priority
 *              count           number of samples of at least this priority
 *
 * Also printed is the scheduling class,
 *
 *		TS		time sharing
 *		IA		interactive
 *		RT		real time
 *		SYS		system
 *		FSS		fair share schedular
 *
 * BASED ON: /usr/demo/dtrace/pri.d
