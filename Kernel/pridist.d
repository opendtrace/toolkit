/*
 * pridist.d - process priority distribution.
 *             Written using DTrace (Solaris 10 3/05)
 *
 * This is a simple DTrace script that samples at 1000 Hz which process
 * is on the CPUs, and what the priority is. A distribution plot is printed.
 *
 * With priorities, the higher the priority the better chance the process
 * (actually, thread) has of being scheduled.
 *
 * This idea came from the script /usr/demo/dtrace/profpri.d, which
 * produces similar output for one particular PID.
 *

 *
 * USAGE:       pridist.d       # hit Ctrl-C to end sampling
 *
 * FIELDS:
 *              CMD             process name
 *              PID             process ID
 *              value           process priority
 *              count           number of samples of at least this priority
 *
 * BASED ON: /usr/demo/dtrace/profpri.d
